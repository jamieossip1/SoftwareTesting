# Software Testing

This is the repository for my software testing project based on my Informatics Large Practical coursework 2 assignment (PizzaDronz service). This repo contains the documentation of my submission (in the /software_testing folder), as well as my code for the ILP project. The testing can be found in ILP-Coursework-main/src/test/java/com/example/ilpcoursework, with test files for all endpoints of CW1, CW2 and some integration testing. The final portfolio is in the file Software_Testing_Portfolio.pdf. The specs for the ILP coursework is located in the folder /Spec which is in the software_testing folder. All code and testing related to the ILP coursework is found in the ILP-Coursework-main folder.
